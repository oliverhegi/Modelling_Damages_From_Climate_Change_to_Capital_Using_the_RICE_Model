# Modelling Damages From Climate Change to Capital Using the RICE Model

This project was completed for a final paper for the course ECONG6449 Economic Theory of Climate Change.

The models used for this project are based on a Python-implementation of William Nordhaus' RICE-2010 Excel model by GitHub user https://github.com/cloutch. The base model, including most of the comments and descriptions, was taken from the following link: https://github.com/cloutch/PyRICE.

[RICE_Baseline.ipynb](https://github.com/oliverhegi/Modelling_Damages_From_Climate_Change_to_Capital_Using_the_RICE_Model/blob/main/RICE_Baseline.ipynb) is RICE-2010 recalibrated to 2015 values and [RICE_Damages_to_Capital.ipynb](https://github.com/oliverhegi/Modelling_Damages_From_Climate_Change_to_Capital_Using_the_RICE_Model/blob/main/RICE_Damages_to_Capital.ipynb) is a modified version of the baseline model that includes climate change damages to capital stocks.
