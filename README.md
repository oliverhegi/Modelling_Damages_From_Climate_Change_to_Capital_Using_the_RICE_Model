# Modelling_Damages_From_Climate_Change_to_Capital_Using_the_RICE_Model

This project was completed for a final paper for the course ECONG6449 Economic Theory of Climate Change.

The models used for this project are based on a Python-implementation of William Nordhaus' RICE-2010 Excel model by GitHub user https://github.com/cloutch. The base model, including most of the comments and descriptions, was taken from the following link: https://github.com/cloutch/PyRICE.
